Notes :
- secret_key needed to use flash messages
- seed used for development/testing app only, it has NO purpose for production
- heroku database need to be updated issue -> delete procfile -> google `dropdb in heroku` -> do step 1 & 2 -> add back procfile



Wishlist :
- proper seed data, run one time only
- in warehouses.html, 'name of store' link back store_show.html, and shows list of warehouses & products under that store
- in warehouse_show.html, show list of products under that store & the parent store
- in product_show.html, show the warehouse & store parent
- stores.html , warehouses.html, products.html ordered by number of warehouse, products, quantity of products respectively
- bootstrap validation on all creating new store, warehouse, product.html
